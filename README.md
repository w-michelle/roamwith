# Roam With

Often times, I would screenshot a place or food to save for later when I plan a trip to that country.  
I decided to create this web app as a potential solution for organizing and saving travel and food bucket list items. The design is partly inspired by Airbnb.
Ultimately, I want to turn this into a mobile app as well.
